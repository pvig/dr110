Arduino controlled midi :  

- trigger voices from midi notes
- play new sounds from original hardware : guiro, cabasa  and more  
- note velocity handling (pulse width trick)


Quick audio samples to let you hear it in action :  

(No fx applied, only a bit of compression,  
The original accent pot still works and note velocity is also applied on some parts)
